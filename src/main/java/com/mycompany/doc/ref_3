1, code -> 1 class per page
            -> homepage -------------------------- -> private By pp = by.id
                                                        -> public filleddata(){findelement(id).sendkey}


            ->

2, test data


3, test code

i create a page obj model for my selenium project
add lots of page and test


A, one class per page

    1. each pageclass has the webele locator as a field;
    in this way helps maintain the scrip as sometimes locators can change and we need to change the locator at one place only

    2. i also write the methds in this page class using this fields which will be called into the testclasses


B, Testbase

    1, create 1 testbase class, with all common methods such as initialization of setup, mousemove, explicitwait, etc.
            write a method setting up annotation (beforeMethod, ...), meaning that method is called before every test.
                i set the implicit wait, do the window maximize, pageloadtimeout, oriwinhandleing, login, also
    2, afterMethod, i quit the driver after each test.

    3, i write seperate classes for tests, while indi test has common features in single class , all thes

    4, Finally, XML FILE, which runs all these class as a suite.


C, Test Data and Config

    1, I never hard code data in the code, i always keep them in seperate files like Excel(poi api) and json(jackson api),
    because test data changes, i just need go to the test data file and change it!
    The code remains unchanged.
